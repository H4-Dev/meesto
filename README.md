meesto
======

A social networking tool I made years ago, similar to Google Plus (before it was out), based on open source and non profit ideals.

This project could not have been accomplished without the wealth of information found on the internet. As a result, you will find parts of code borrowed from other developers. I thank everyone immensely.

The purpose of creating a github repository for Meesto is to share the code with many people who have asked to see it. I see this as my way of paying what I learned forward. I hope others will find it useful.
