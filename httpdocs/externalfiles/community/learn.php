		<div align="left" class="paragraph" style="margin-left: 12px; margin-top: 4px;">
			Using the community is easy. The community has three main options: projects, feedback, and bugs. Projects allow to suggest new ideas, changes to the site, or changes to Meesto in general. Feedback allows you to quickly and easily share your thoughts on Meesto. Bugs for reporting problems with current features of Meesto. All three of these areas allow discussion so your ideas can progress and grow.

		<div align="left" class="paragraph" style="margin-left: 12px; margin-top: 4px;">
			You are free to discuss Meesto as you wish, assuming your content is not deemed by the community to beharmful, offensive, pornographic, or otherwise inappropriate. The only mediation in the Community is choosing which projects and bugs become the focus of our development team. At this time, there is no exact science for how decisions like this are made. We base our decisions on amount of support by the community and perceived relevancy/importance of the project or bug. Getting a majority of the community to support your project or bug will ensure that it will come to fruition.

			Don\'t shy away from sharing your ideas or commenting on others. There are no requirements for using the community but we highly suggest you do. You control what Meesto is; the community is your chance to turn that statement into a reality.

		<div align="left" class="paragraph" style="margin-left: 12px; margin-top: 4px;">
			As Meesto grows and changes, the structure of the Community may expand and change, but no matter what, it will always hold true to its founding goal of providing a place to discuss, develop, and build Meesto.
