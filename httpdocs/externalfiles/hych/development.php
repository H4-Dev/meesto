As an Open Source Community member you get to build a social tool that will be potentially used by millions of people. Not only will it be a great experience, you\'ll be giving something back to the world &mdash; you\'ll be giving people a social tool that respects them and respects their data.</div>

		<div align="left" class="paragraph" style="margin-left: 24px; margin-top: 4px;">The Open Source Community structure and guidelines will be determined by the Open Source Community itself. We\'re just getting started so there isn\'t much to say yet. But we will say, that whatever it is, it will be something that works for you.</div>

		<div align="left" class="p24">What Will Be Required Of You...</div>
		<div align="left" class="paragraph" style="margin-left: 24px; margin-top: 4px;">A good attitude and good communication. You will be able to choose your level of involvement. All we really ask is that you follow through with what you\'re doing and if problems arise, communicate them to the Open Source Community before they become a really big problem. </div>
