			As of now we are only spending money on two things totaling about $640/year:
			<ol>
				<li>Domain Names: on a yearly basis we renew our ownership of meesto.com, meesto.org, and meesto.net which costs between $30-$40/year.</li>
				<li>Web Hosting: purchased from Network Redux, we are currently using the cheapest options which costs about $50/month (expect this to increase dramatically as Meesto becomes more popular) </li>
			</ol>

		<div align="left" class="p24">What We Are Saving Money For / Future Financial Obligations....</div>
		<div align="left" class="paragraph" style="margin-left: 24px; margin-top: 4px;">Our main focus is on forming a Nonprofit corporation and attaining proper legal status. From there we will formalize our business operations and hopefully have an actual office. This is expected cost tens-of-thousands (potentially hundreds-of-thousands) of dollars.</div>

		<div align="left" class="p24">How Our Money Is Handled...</div>
		<div align="left" class="paragraph" style="margin-left: 24px; margin-top: 4px;">As of now, because we do not currently have an appropriate legal status, donations are given to Sean Bolton exclusively for Meesto. There is nothing to fear here; the process is completely transparent and is run like a Nonprofit corporation. You will know where your money goes and what Meesto generally spends money on &mdash; all this information should be on this page. Please understand, we cannot track all orders specifically but you will get a general explanation of how much was donated and where the money went.</div>
